# Documentation Index & Governance Map
# Purpose: Single entry point for Agents/Humans to locate (Read) and contribute (Write) knowledge.
# Last Updated: 2026-02-20

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Repositories (single source for "latest version")
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
repos:
  backend:
    url: https://github.com/manni17/steller-backend
    description: ".NET API, EF, Hangfire, Bamboo integration, tests. Clone path e.g. /opt/steller-v2/steller-backend."
  ops:
    url: https://github.com/manni17/steller-v2-ops
    description: "Deploy (docker-compose, scripts) + this docs tree (BACKLOG_V2, INDEX, qa, architecture, product)."
# When in doubt: backend = application code; ops = deploy + docs. This INDEX lives in ops repo under docs/.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Start: Pick your role in the "roles:" section below. Load that role's "docs:" list first.
# Then use "canonical_sources" and "write_to" for reads and writes. Use "zones" for write targets.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Verification Rule for Agents
# Before any "Write" action:
# 1. Consult docs/INDEX.yaml -> zones
# 2. Match the task type to the write_when trigger
# 3. Target the designated path
# 4. Update the relevant role's read list in INDEX.yaml if the new document is a persistent reference
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Writing Convention: New documents in docs/ root must use a prefix (e.g. ADR_, INCIDENT_, PROPOSAL_, AUDIT_, REPORT_). Prefer subfolders when a zone path exists.

# Quick Reference
# - Read: Pick role -> load docs/read list for that role
# - Write: Match task to zones.write_when -> use zones.path; update role read list if adding persistent reference
# - Prefixes for docs/ root: ADR_, INCIDENT_, PROPOSAL_, AUDIT_, REPORT_
